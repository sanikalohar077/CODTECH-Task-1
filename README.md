OVERVIEW
This Java program, SimpleCalculator, allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations on two integers. Here's an overview of what each part of the code does:
1. Imports and Class Declaration:
   - It imports the Scanner class from java.util package for input handling and declares a class named SimpleCalculator.
2. Main Method
   - The main method initializes a Scanner object to read input from the console.
   - It prompts the user to enter two integers (firstNumber and secondNumber) and the type of operation (operation).
   - It then calls performOperation method with these inputs and prints the result.
3. performOperation Method:
   - This method takes firstNumber, secondNumber, and operation as parameters.
   - It performs the corresponding arithmetic operation based on the value of operation (either addition, subtraction, multiplication, modulus, or division).
   - If an invalid operation is entered, it prints "Invalid operation".
4. Output:
   - After performing the operation, the program outputs the result to the console

This Java program is a simple console-based calculator that demonstrates basic input handling (Scanner class), method usage (performOperation), conditional statements (if-else), and arithmetic operations. It's designed to be straightforward and handles basic error cases, such as invalid operations.
